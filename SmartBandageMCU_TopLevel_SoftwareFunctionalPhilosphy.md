This section details the software programming implemented on the MCUs in the smart bandage(s) and the central unit. The BLE communication on both the MCUs is implemented using LLD (Low Level Drivers). LLD APIs are used because they provide a high degree of customization of BLE parameters and give a high degree of control over how the BLE communication and user code execution are achieved. The downside to using LLD APIs is that STM32CubeMX code generation software does not support these APIs; thus all configurations described in the following section is done by C programming. The central unit follows all the same steps stated for hardware configuration and initialization for the smart bandage except GPIO and I2C initialization as these peripherals are not used by it.
